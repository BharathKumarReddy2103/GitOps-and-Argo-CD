# GitOps and Argo CD for DevOps Engineers

Welcome to the **GitOps and Argo CD** repository. This repository is a centralized knowledge hub for all things GitOps and Argo CD, designed specifically for DevOps Engineers looking to implement, learn, and master GitOps principles and Argo CD usage in real-world scenarios.

---

## What is GitOps?

GitOps is a modern software development and operations paradigm that uses Git as the single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications. It enables:

- Version-controlled infrastructure
- Automated deployments via Git events
- Easy rollback and change audit history
- Improved collaboration between teams

---

## What is Argo CD?

[Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. It allows you to:

- Automatically synchronize your applications from Git to Kubernetes
- Visualize deployment status through a web UI
- Manage multi-cluster deployments
- Track and rollback changes with Git as the source of truth
